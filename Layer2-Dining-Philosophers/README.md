Dining Philosophers Problem (Layer 2)

This project implements the Dining Philosophers Problem using `pthreads` and `semaphores` in C.
The solution uses the Asymmetric Deadlock Prevention Strategy, which avoids circular wait conditions.

Deadlock Prevention Strategy:

Asymmetric Strategy
- Odd-numbered philosophers (1, 3, 5) pick up their left chopstick first, then the right.
- Even-numbered philosophers (2, 4) pick up their right chopstick first, then the left.
- This approach breaks the circular wait condition, ensuring that a deadlock never occurs.
